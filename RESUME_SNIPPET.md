**Health AI Chatbot: Multi-Agent Diabetes Risk Prediction System**

---

## Resume-Ready Description

### Short Version (1-2 lines for resume bullet point)
Developed an intelligent health assistant combining ML-based diabetes risk prediction with RAG-powered medical insights, featuring hybrid search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and automated citation validation for trustworthy clinical information.

### Medium Version (3-4 lines for detailed resume entry)
Built a production-ready health AI chatbot that integrates XGBoost-based diabetes risk assessment with a multi-agent conversational system. Implemented advanced RAG architecture using hybrid search (semantic + BM25), cross-encoder re-ranking, and query expansion for medical term understanding. Achieved 100% citation coverage and 40-60% relevance improvement over basic semantic search by indexing 6,328+ medical document chunks from ADA 2024 guidelines.

### Extended Version (Full project description)
Architected and developed a comprehensive diabetes risk prediction system combining machine learning and natural language processing. The application features: (1) XGBoost model trained on BRFSS 2015 dataset for diabetes risk assessment with interactive visualizations, (2) Multi-agent chatbot system with Gemini API for personalized health coaching, and (3) Advanced RAG implementation with Qdrant cloud vector database, hybrid retrieval, cross-encoder re-ranking, and automated citation validation. Deployed on Streamlit Cloud with production-grade error handling and scalable architecture.
